API Integration
The application fetches product details from an external API. The API endpoint and authentication details are hardcoded for simplicity.

Dummy Data for Frequently Bought Together Products
In the ProductDetails component, dummy data is used to display frequently bought together products. This data is static and can be replaced with dynamic data from an API in the future.
